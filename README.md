# Homework-3---Part-2
The convergence rate of nodal-averaged stresses was incluided into the code

### Create 3 meshes for this problem coarse (the one submitted last homework, medium and fine). Solve the stress problem in each mesh and plot the absolute maximum of each stress component for each mesh. 
#### MESH 1: element size factor 2.26

We can see that the absolute maximum stress is higher in fine mesh. This can tell as that the analysis of this example, is better in fine mesh, because of the exactitude of the results. This occurs because of the change of stress along the element. Also, we set more concentration of quadrangles near the hole to estimate in a better way the stress around it. 
In the images we can see the different behaviours of the meshes. It's funny to try different meshes and realize that show results that change the performance of the element.
